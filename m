First of all, I am looking for an international experience, I have always been looking for new challenges and experiences, and this will be a good opportunity to once again step out of my comfort zone and seek a new mission in a new country with a different work culture. During my 7 years of career as a Java developer I have worked with European, American and Chinese teams which allowed me to learn how to adapt and integrate in different environments. Today I want to take this step to continue in the same direction, take up a new challenge and get closer to my roots as I have Arab origins. 
And back to the job description, it fits my profile and I can see that I have all the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in this position.
